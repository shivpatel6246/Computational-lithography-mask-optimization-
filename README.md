this project was a personal introduction to ML for me. I tried to create a model to predict the output printed image of a photolithographic process. I used the lithobench dataset of metal circuit printing to determine how real world manufacturing tolerances,
material properties and non ideal methods can lead to non ideal printed shapes. This model aimed to showcase how a non-ideal input design would actually be printed based on abstracted characterisitcs of the machine itself. It could in theory be used as a tool for 
chip designers to determine the existince of lithographic hotspots before they occur.
